I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Italian National Research Council, Institute of Biostructure and Bioimaging](http://www.ibb.cnr.it/) in Naples, Italy. I am a computational chemist, with particular interest in theoretical photochemistry. Currently I am investigating the ultrafast dynamics and spectroscopy of DNA, ranging from individual nucleobases, to base pairs, double helix, and quadruplex structures. The techniques I am using for this include quantum dynamics, time-dependent density functional theory, and excitonic modelling calculations. I am also involved in the co-ordination of the [LightDyNAmics](https://www.lightdynamics.eu/) Marie Sklodowska-Curie European Training Network, consisting of 15 Early Stage Researchers and 14 Principal Investigators at 13 EU Institutions, using DNA as a training platform for photodynamic processes in soft materials.
