I am a Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow at Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany with [Prof. Irene Burghardt](https://www.theochem.uni-frankfurt.de/). I specialise in computational and theoretical chemistry, with a particular interest in method development in quantum chemistry and dynamics, and application to photochemistry and molecular materials. Currently, I am engaged with projects on molecules for organic photovoltaics, semiconductors and photoswitches.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Italian National Research Council, Institute of Biostructure and Bioimaging in Naples, Italy, with [Dr. Roberto Improta](http://www.ibb.cnr.it/?command=viewu&id=415&lang=en) investigating the ultrafast dynamics and spectroscopy of DNA. I also worked closely with [Dr. Fabrizio Santoro](http://www.pi.iccom.cnr.it/people/fabrizio-santoro) at the Institute of Chemistry of Organometallic Compounds in Pisa, with whom I developed the [Overdia](http://www.iccom.cnr.it/en/overdia-en/) code to convert TD-DFT data into parameters for excitonic and quantum dynamics models.  

I carried out a PhD at the University of Leeds from 2014-2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Dmitry Shalashilin](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/4197/professor-dmitry-shalashilin). My PhD project was primarily concerned with method development of the coupled coherent states method of quantum dynamics, and I also got my first taste of theoretical photochemistry, thanks to a collaborative project with [Prof. Vas Stavros](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/stavros/stavrosgroup/) and Dr. Neil Cole-Filipiak at the University of Warwick on ultrafast photodissociation.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in chemistry from Durham University in 2010-2014, including a Masters project with [Prof. David Tozer](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/d-j-tozer/) on density functional theory, where my passion for quantum chemistry truly began.
