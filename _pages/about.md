I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Italian National Research Council, Institute of Biostructure and Bioimaging in Naples, Italy, with [Dr. Roberto Improta](http://www.ibb.cnr.it/?command=viewu&id=415&lang=en). I also work closely with [Dr. Fabrizio Santoro](http://www.pi.iccom.cnr.it/people/fabrizio-santoro) at the Institute of Chemistry of Organometallic Compounds in Pisa. I am a computational chemist, with a particular interest in theoretical photochemistry and quantum mechanical methods. Currently I am investigating the ultrafast dynamics and spectroscopy of DNA, ranging from individual nucleobases, to base pairs, double helix, and quadruplex structures. The techniques I am using for this include quantum dynamics, time-dependent density functional theory, and excitonic modelling calculations. I am also involved in the co-ordination of the [LightDyNAmics](https://www.lightdynamics.eu/) Marie Sklodowska-Curie European Training Network, consisting of 15 Early Stage Researchers and 14 Principal Investigators at 13 EU Institutions, using DNA as a training platform for photodynamic processes in soft materials.

Previously I carried out a PhD at the University of Leeds from 2014-2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Dmitry Shalashilin](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/4197/professor-dmitry-shalashilin). My PhD project was primarily concerned with method development of the coupled coherent states method of quantum dynamics, and I also got my first taste of theoretical photochemistry, thanks to a collaborative project with [Prof. Vas Stavros](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/stavros/stavrosgroup/) and Dr. Neil Cole-Filipiak at the University of Warwick on ultrafast photodissociation.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in chemistry from Durham University in 2010-2014, including a Masters project with [Prof. David Tozer](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/d-j-tozer/) on density functional theory, where my passion for quantum chemistry truly began.
